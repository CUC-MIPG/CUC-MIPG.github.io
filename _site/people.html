    I am now an associate professor at the School of Information and Communication Engineering and State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence and Communication, Communication University of China.

  I  have obtained my P.H.D degree from Peking University in July, 2021. (Institute of Digital Media which is directed by Prof. Wen Gao)
  
  I received the B.E. degree in Digital Media Technology and B.A. degree in Journalism in 2016 from Communication University of China.
  
  My current research interests lie in 
  
  AIGC (Image/Video Controllable Generation and Editing)
  
  Image/Video Compression based on Generative Models.
  
  I am supervised by Prof. Siwei Ma and have been a visiting Ph.D. student at Vision and Learning Lab at University of California, Merced, under the supervision of Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang
  
  I am lucky to have opportunities to work with Dr. Hsin-Ying Lee (Snap research), Dr. Hung-Yu Tseng (Meta), Dr.Jia-Bin Huang (University of Maryland), Dr. Shiqi Wang (City University of Hong Kong), Dr. Xinfeng Zhang
