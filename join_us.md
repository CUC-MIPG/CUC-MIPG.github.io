# Graduate students or Undergraduates


MIPG provides a wonderful environment for students interested in AIGC. Therefore, MIPG has the following requirements for accepting graduate and undergraduate students:
- **English**.
Students interested in joining MIPG should possess excellent English reading and writing skills. This is crucial as much of the cutting-edge research, technical documentation, and scholarly articles in the field of AI are predominantly available in English. Students should be able to comprehend complex technical material, engage with academic literature, and articulate their ideas and research findings effectively in written English.

- **Research and Information Gathering Ability**. Candidates should have strong research skills, especially in gathering and synthesizing information from various sources. This includes the ability to conduct comprehensive literature reviews, identify relevant research papers, and extract pertinent information. Students should be adept at using academic databases, search engines, and other digital tools to locate and organize information relevant to AI research.
- **Programming**. Proficiency in Python is essential for students joining the AI research team. Python is a leading programming language in AI and machine learning due to its simplicity and the vast array of libraries and frameworks available, like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Students should be comfortable with writing, debugging, and understanding Python code, and should be familiar with basic programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.

- **Foundational Knowledge in Deep Learning**. A basic understanding of deep learning is a prerequisite for the research group. Students should have foundational knowledge in neural networks, including how they are structured, trained, and utilized in various AI applications. Familiarity with concepts such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and common training techniques is important. This foundational knowledge will be crucial for contributing to research projects and understanding advanced topics in AI.

- **Additional Skills and Qualities**. Besides the technical skills, students should possess qualities such as curiosity, a strong work ethic, and the ability to work collaboratively in a team. Good problem-solving skills, creativity in approaching complex challenges, and a genuine interest in AI and its applications are highly valued. Experience with data analysis, experience in using AI in practical applications, or a background in related fields like statistics or computer science can be additional assets.

**If you plan on applying,** keep a few things in mind:
- It's best to contact Qi Mao in advance if you have a strong interest in our lab. Some programs may be a better fit for you than others. _Please also indicate which program(s) you are targeting._
- You can send your resume to this email:**qimao@cuc.edu.cn** if you want to join MIPG. The content includes but is not limited to your CET-4 and CET-6 scores, undergraduate transcripts, research or internship experience, skill mastery, etc. We will interview you based on your resume. You can become an intern through an interview, and the internship period ranges from 3 months to 6 months.
